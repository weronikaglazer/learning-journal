                        <h1>Hi! My name is Weronika and welcome to my learning journal ðŸ“–</h1>
                        <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Develoepr Career Path, I managed to create some simple, yet successful projects which you can open and use below.</p>

                    <h4>How I stay commited to learning..</h4>

                    <p>I teach myself something every single day, even if it's a small thing. This way, I don't get overwhelmed, but instead stay excited for grasping more and more knowledge gradually.
                    <br>
                    Every day is a new beginning!
                    </p>

                    <h4>Where I am now..</h4>

                    <p>My learning path started at the beginning of last year when I learned the basics of JavaScript. It's awesome to now look at the progress I made and what I can build now completely by myself!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Right now after some time spent learning <b>HTML&CSS and JavaScript</b> (also <b>Python</b> on the side) I am approaching the <b>React</b> path and soon I'll be able to showcase some projects using it! Stay tuned....</p>

                    <p>Today I made a color scheme generator app all by myself, putting to use my knowledge of APIs. It turned out pretty good and I think I might even use it myself!!</p>

                    <p>I managed to make a really cool app which acts like Tinder but for...dogs!! It was really fun making it and practicing my JavaScript skills. Cute huh?</p>

                    <p>Let me introduce you to this cute little Flowershop Ordering App which simulates an online store and placing an order. It was a challenge for me but I solved it as you can see!</p>
